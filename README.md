# How to build a Vue app with Safe and passkeys

This example app shows how to create a [Vue](https://vuejs.org) app for using passkeys in your Safe. Please read [How to build an app with Safe and passkeys](https://docs.safe.global/home/passkeys-tutorials/safe-passkeys-nuxt) to see how this app was created.

## What youâ€™ll need

**Prerequisite knowledge:** You will need some basic experience with Vue, [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction), and [ERC-4337](https://docs.safe.global/home/4337-overview).

Before progressing with the tutorial, please make sure you have:

- Downloaded and installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- Created an API key from [Pimlico](https://www.pimlico.io/).


## Getting Started

To install this example application, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/5afe/safe-passkeys-nuxt.git
cd safe-passkeys-nuxt
pnpm i
```

This will get a copy of the project installed locally. Now, create a file named `.env` at the root of your project, and add your Pimlico API key to it:

```bash
echo "NUXT_PUBLIC_PIMLICO_API_KEY='your_pimlico_api_key_goes_here'" > .env
```

Run the local development server with the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the application.
